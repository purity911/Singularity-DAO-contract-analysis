- **Call Method**: call (via SafeERC20's safeTransfer)

### Explanation

#### Purpose

The purpose of the `_pushUnderlying` function is to safely transfer a specified amount of ERC20 tokens from the contractâ€™s address to another address.

#### Detailed Usage

This function uses the `safeTransfer` method from the `SafeERC20` library, which internally performs a high-level call to the ERC20 token's `transfer` function. The `safeTransfer` method ensures that the transfer operation is executed correctly and reverts the transaction if the transfer fails. This function is employed to distribute tokens out from the contract, ensuring that recipients receive their intended amounts without errors.

#### Impact

The `_pushUnderlying` function is essential for securely distributing tokens from the contract. It is used in various processes, such as handling user withdrawals, distributing rewards, and managing token exits from the Dynaset. By ensuring safe and reliable token transfers, this function helps maintain user trust and the integrity of the protocol.
